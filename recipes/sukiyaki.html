          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>To make the cold brew Kombu Dashi, put 2 cups water and 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) in a measuring cup or pitcher. Set it aside to steep for a minimum of 30 minutes, or make it ahead up to overnight.</li>
            <li>To make the sukiyaki sauce, combine ½ cup sake and ½ cup mirin in a small saucepan. Bring it to a boil and reduce the heat to simmer and let the alcohol evaporate for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>Add 3 Tbsp sugar and ½ cup soy sauce and mix together. Bring it back to a boil. Once the sugar is completely dissolved, turn off the heat and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Transfer the sauce to a pitcher and bring both the dashi and the sauce to the table. Tip: You can make the sukiyaki sauce ahead and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.</li>
            <li>Cut 4 leaves napa cabbage into pieces 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Cut the pieces in half or thirds down along the thick white center of the leaves.</li>
            <li>Cut ¼ bunch shungiku (chrysanthemum greens) 2 inches (5 cm) wide.</li>
            <li>Slice the white part of 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) diagonally into ½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces.</li>
            <li>Scrape off the outer skin of 6 inches gobo (burdock root) with the back of a knife. The gobo‘s flavor is just under the skin, so don‘t use a vegetable peeler and peel that flavor away. Once you scrape off the skin, shave the gobo into superthin strips using a vegetable peeler Soak the gobo strips in water for 5 minutes, changing the water once. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Cut ½ onion into ½-inch (1.3 cm) slices widthwise. Next, discard the bottom part of ½ package enoki mushrooms and tear it into smaller clusters.</li>
            <li>Cut off and discard the root ends of ½ package maitake mushrooms and separate the maitake bunch into 2 small clusters.</li>
            <li>Cut off and discard the stems of 2 shiitake mushrooms. Optionally, you can cut a flower pattern on the shiitake mushroom caps: First, cut a sliver off the top of the mushroom cap by making 2 incisions in the shape of a “V". Bevel these cuts toward each other by inserting the knife at an angle.</li>
            <li>Make a second cutout in the same manner to form an "X" with the first cutout. You can keep this "X" pattern or add one or two more cutouts. Watch my video on "shiitake hanagiri" that demonstrates this Japanese cutting technique.</li>
            <li>Cut ½ package broiled tofu (yaki dofu) into smaller pieces. We usually double the tofu portion and cut one block into 6–8 pieces.</li>
            <li>Rinse and drain ½ package shirataki noodles. Cut the noodles in half. Add the shirataki noodles to boiling water to remove any odor. Once the water is boiling again, cook for 2 minutes, drain, and set aside.</li>
            <l1>Place ½ lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) and suet (if using) on a plate. Put all the ingredients on a big platter or bamboo tray for the dining table.</l1>
