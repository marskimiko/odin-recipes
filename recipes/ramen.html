  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ginger</li>
    <li>1 shallot</li>
    <li>1 tbs toasted white sesame seeds</li>
    <li>1/4 lb ground pork</li>
    <li>1 tsp doubanjiang</li>
    <li>3 tbsp miso</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock/broth</li>
    <li>1 tsp diamond crystal kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp white pepper powder</li>
    <li>2 servings fresh ramen noodles</li>
    <li>homemade chashu</li>
    <li>ramen egg</li>
    <li>nori</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Mince or press 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press) and add to a small plate. Then, grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and add ½ tsp ginger (grated) to the plate.</li>
    <li>Mince 1 shallot and add to the plate and set these three prepared ingredients aside.</li>
    <li>Grind 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds, leaving some seeds unground for texture. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Preheat a medium pot over medium-low heat. When it‘s hot, add 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil. Then, add the garlic, ginger, and shallot.</li>
    <li>With a wooden spatula, stir-fry until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add ¼ lb ground pork and increase the heat to medium. Cook the meat until it‘s no longer pink</li>
    <li>Add 1 tsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste) and 3 Tbsp miso. Quickly blend well with the meat before they get burnt.</li>
    <li>Add the ground sesame seeds and 1 Tbsp sugar and mix well.</li>
    <li>Add 1 Tbsp sake and 4 cups chicken stock/broth and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Taste your soup and add up to 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (if necessary) and ¼ tsp white pepper powder. Tip: Each brand of chicken stock varies in saltiness, so you must taste your soup to decide how much salt to add.</li>
    <li>Your soup broth is now done. Cover with the lid and keep the soup broth simmering while you cook the noodles.</li>
    <li>When the noodles are done, quickly pick them up with a mesh sieve and shake out the excess water. Make sure to drain the water well, as you don’t want it to dilute your soup. Serve the noodles into the warmed bowls.</li>
    <li>Place the toppings of your choice on the ramen noodles and serve immediately. Add the optional condiments to your Miso Ramen and enjoy</li>
  </ol>
